# RAM Paxos: a performance comparison

This project presents a simple implementation of Paxos in Python, and several
workloads that are used to measure its performance with different configurations.
In particular, we will be measuring the performance of the algorithm when the
ledgers must be written to a durable and reliable storage (such as the disk),
and when it can remain in RAM.
